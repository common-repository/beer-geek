Beer management for breweries and beer geeks using custom post types and taxonomies.

== Description ==

Beer Geek was created by the team at [Four Stacks Brewing](http://fourstacksbrewing.com) in order to create and manage beers on our website. While the plugin is still young, it will be actively developed into a full-featured plugin.

Currently, we offer a custom "Beer" post type (bg_beer), and a custom "Style" taxonomy (bg_style). We will eventually support custom metadata, but for now rely on custom fields to do the bulk of that work.

Stay tuned for more info.

== Installation ==

Install as you would any standard WordPress plugin. CPT and taxonomies are created automatically.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

None yet!

== Support ==

We will do our best to answer support tickets, but please keep in mind that we are brewers, not developers, so our responses may be delayed.
